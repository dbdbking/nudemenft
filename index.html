      <p class="soon">The NudemeNFT is a collection of 9,999 unique interactive artworks living on the Ethereum blockchain. Each artwork (token) animates up to 2,500 programmed Nudemen, relentlessly forming a pattern, an artwork or a message chosen from a curated library of images.</p>
      <p class="soon"><b>On-chain Metadata</b><br>When you buy (mint) a NudemeNFT token, a unique set of attributes (metadata) will be generated based on your transaction and token ID’s. These attributes will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain immutably. They are like the DNA of Nudemen, they determine how your Nudemen behave, how fast they move and even how lazy they are to visualize the image that they believe art is.</p>
      <p class="soon"><b>Viewing the Artwork</b><br>After minting your token, you can find your piece on Opensea and this website. You can view and interact with it in any modern browser that supports Javascript (p5.js). The program to render and display the work is stored on a decentralized file system (IPFS).</p>
      <p class="soon"><b>Samples</b><br>Mona Lisa, Lonely Man and LFG!</p>
      <p class="soon"><b>How to Buy/Mint</b><br>Currently, the NudemeNFT can only be minted directly from our smart contract on Etherscan with a discounted price of 0.05E. Maximum number of tokens per transaction is 10. Minting from a contract requires technical understanding of how smart contracts and Ethereum blockchain work. Please only proceed if you know what you’re doing.</p>

      <p class="soon"> <b>About The Nudemen Series</b><br>The Nudemen Series is an ongoing art project that aims to raise sociological questions in the post-Internet era. The project was originally inspired and created to counterbalance the overwhelming female nudity over the Internet (Nudemessenger, 2003). The series has taken an utopian approach to depict technology, culture and reality in different forms and media.<br><br>

The work has been awarded and exhibited in multiple venues such as Ars Electronica, Japan Media Arts Festival and New Vision Arts Festival. <br></p>
